# BeanCount

This app was designed for iD Tech Bean Count. Given a 
list of names from different locations, the students 
can be toggled on or off depending on if they are in
attendance or not. It allows users to login and select
a location. Then they can see the students at this
location and their attenance details.

As a back-end, this app uses a Firebase database
for user accounts and database information.

### Instalation

To install, clone the repo and run in xcode on your
iDevice. Requires an Apple developer account.

### Usage

To use this app, create an account and log in. Then
simply choose a location of camp, or create a new
one, then view the students. Users can add and delete
students, as well as mark them absent. These changes
are reflected on all devices connected to the location.

### Contributions

Feel free to fork this repo and add what you'd like to
see or use any of the code you wish. Plans are to make
this repo private at some point in the future.

Feel free to submit a pull request as well if you make
some super extra awesome feature :D

#### History

Not much. I just started this app reciently. I have
thus far added a login screen and a create account
screen (as of 7-16-2016). 

#### Credits

The basic idea of this app came from Snuggles, with
a design concept from Lion-O.
